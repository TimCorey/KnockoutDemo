KnockoutDemo
============

A KnockoutJS demonstration project used in presentations about Knockout. This website contains three demo projects, each of which are a complete website. Demo1 and Demo2 have both an initial version and a complete version. This will allow the user to recreate the demonstration while allowing for a working version to check against. Demo3 does not have an initial state because of the complexity of the demonstration. Instead, there is a complete version with a number of tricky problems that have been overcome. The viewer can use these as aids in designing their own project using Knockout.
